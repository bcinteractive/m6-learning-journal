                        <p>
                            As I take my journey through Scrimba Frontend Developer Path, I've come to learn the value of modern HTML, CSS, Javascript.  Now, I'm integrating my learning to my current library of knowledge.

                    <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
                    <p>
                        I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
                    </p>

                    <h3>How I got started</h3>

                    <p>
                        I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        While most of the paragraphs here are copied along the way while on Scrimba course.  It is true to me and I believe true to most others who are learning and mastering their craft.  I need to borrow the words as they worked for me.
